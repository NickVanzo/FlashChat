# FlashChat
This is a messaging app prototype inspired by whatsapp. 
This project was made possible thanks to CocoaPods and Firebase.
List of cocoapods used: 
  - https://cocoapods.org/pods/CLTypingLabel 
  This first cocoapod was used to animate the title in the first ViewController.

  - https://cocoapods.org/pods/IQKeyboardManager 
  This second cocoapod was used to move the UI up when the user use the Keyboard. If not imported the keyboard overlaps with the "Send button".

The database where all the information is stored (AKA: users email and messages) is provided by Firebase. Authentication (login and registration), security and Database functions come from Firebas too.
See you in space cowboy.
